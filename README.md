# Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on on 27 October, 2016.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

## Program Outline:

Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision

## 1. Deep Learning

   * P1: Finding Lane Lines

     When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

     In this project I detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images. 

    * P2: Traffic Sign Classifier

    In this project, I will use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I  then tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.
